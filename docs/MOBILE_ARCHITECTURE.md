# Mobile App Configuration for Room Dates

This document outlines the mobile-first configuration for the Room Dates web application, designed to be ready for CapacitorJS integration.

## Mobile-First Design Principles

### 1. Touch-Friendly Interface

- Minimum touch target size: 44px x 44px
- Proper spacing between interactive elements
- Swipe gestures for navigation where appropriate
- Pull-to-refresh functionality

### 2. Performance Optimizations

- Code splitting for faster initial load
- Image optimization with responsive sizes
- Lazy loading for non-critical content
- Efficient caching strategies

### 3. Responsive Design

- Mobile-first CSS with progressive enhancement
- Breakpoints: xs (375px), sm (640px), md (768px), lg (1024px)
- Safe area handling for devices with notches
- Flexible layouts that work across all screen sizes

## Schema Architecture

The Convex schema is designed with mobile-first considerations:

### Core Tables

1. **userProfiles** - Extended user information beyond auth
2. **rooms** - Physical spaces with location data
3. **events** - Time-based gatherings within rooms
4. **eventApplications** - User applications to join events
5. **connections** - Direct relationships between users
6. **messages** - Real-time messaging between connections
7. **messageReadStatus** - Message read tracking
8. **eventViews** - Analytics and recommendations
9. **securityEvents** - Comprehensive security logging

### Key Design Decisions

#### Denormalization for Performance

- `ownerId` stored in both `rooms` and `events` tables
- Reduces join operations for mobile queries

#### Efficient Indexing

- Composite indexes for common query patterns
- Separate indexes for active/inactive states
- Time-based indexes for chronological data

#### Real-time Friendly

- All tables designed for Convex's reactive queries
- Optimized for live updates in messaging and applications

## Mobile Development Features

### Progressive Web App (PWA) Ready

- Configured for offline capability
- Mobile-optimized manifest
- Service worker integration planned

### CapacitorJS Preparation

- Host configuration allows external connections
- Mobile-friendly build targets
- Touch and gesture optimization
- Native mobile API integration points

### Performance Features

- Lazy loading components
- Virtual scrolling for long lists
- Image optimization and caching
- Efficient state management

## Development Workflow

### Mobile Testing

```bash
# Start dev server accessible from mobile devices
npm run dev

# Build and preview mobile-optimized version
npm run build && npm run preview
```

### Future CapacitorJS Integration

The project is structured to easily add:

1. Native device capabilities (camera, location, push notifications)
2. App store deployment
3. Native mobile UI components
4. Device-specific optimizations

## Security Considerations

Mobile-specific security measures:

- Comprehensive security event logging
- Rate limiting protection
- Secure authentication flow
- Safe area handling for sensitive UI elements

## Next Steps

1. Implement core Convex functions for data operations
2. Build mobile-optimized Svelte components
3. Add real-time messaging functionality
4. Implement offline capability
5. Prepare for CapacitorJS integration
